# Save the meme - Global Game JAM 2024

## The scope

This repo was used for the 2024 Golbal Game JAM participation.
This year's theme was **Make me Laugh** so we aimed to create a game where the player could chace down the memes that escaped from the internet imto the backrooms.

## realisation

This game was created using Unity (2022.3.18LTS) in less than 48 hours. 
It consists of a first intro scene with a small introscreen and a second main scene with the actual game. The main scene features a proceduraly generated maze where memes spawn. The player can move around in the maze using a keyboard and a mouse for camera orientation.

Given the limited time and small team, we couldn't fully finish the game or completely debug the game but we achieved a somewhat functional version of it.
Feel free to give some feedback, it could be usefull for future game jams.
